The project seeks to apply foundational statistical methods to uncover meaningful patterns, associations, and predictive relationships within the mtcars dataset.
The main goals were:
1. To understand the basic properties of key variables by calculating measures of central tendency (mean), variability (standard deviation), and shape.
2. To investigate the linear relationship between horsepower and fuel efficiency using Pearson’s correlation, which helps identify how changes in engine power relate to changes in miles per gallon.
3. To develop a simple linear regression model predicting fuel efficiency from horsepower, providing insights on how these two variables interact and quantifying the strength and direction of their relationship.
4. To visually illustrate the relationship between horsepower and fuel efficiency.
